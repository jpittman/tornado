Running the Tornado App.Net example
=====================================

To get the demo running, you will need to have an ADN developer account and 
register a new app at the following link:

https://account.app.net/developer/apps/

You will need to create a callback URL at creation time.  For quick testing, specify the following: 

http://localhost:8888/auth/login

Don't worry, you can make changes later or add additional urls.

From there, just run the adn.py like any other tornado app.
